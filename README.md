#  DSA From Scratch Journey

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey — from absolute scratch**.

This repository documents my learning path from basics, practice problems, notes, mistakes, and progress as I build my DSA fundamentals step by step.

I’m not here to pretend I know everything.  
I’m here to learn properly, consistently, and publicly.

Why This Repository?

- To build **strong DSA fundamentals**
- To track my **daily/weekly progress**
- To revise concepts easily in the future
- To stay disciplined & accountable
- To show **real growth**, not perfection
